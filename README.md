# introduction
The current project involves the use of car sales data to predict the price of a car. To achieve this, it is essential to first identify the independent variables that influence the target variable, which is the price, by utilizing statistical methods such as correlation, Pearson, and ANOVA. Additionally, plotting techniques such as regression plot and box plot can be employed to further aid in this process. The ultimate goal of these methods is to accurately identify the variables that have a significant impact on the price of a car and subsequently enable precise predictions. By leveraging a combination of these techniques, it is possible to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the factors that influence the price of a car and to generate more accurate predictions.
